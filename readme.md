# Conan-Test

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/newlawrence/Conan-Test.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/newlawrence/Conan-Test)

A small proof of concept about using a C++ package manager using:
* **Travis**, as the cloud continuous integration platform.
* **CMake**, as the build generator system.
* **Conan**, as the package manager.
* **Catch**, as the test driver library.
